# PROJECT SMART HOME AUTOMATION

## AIM
To print smart home automation guide on serial monitor for lighting system

COMPONENTS
1.	ESP8266 NodeMCU
2.	LDR Sensor Module
3.	USB cable
4.	Jumper Wire

CONNECTION
LDR Sensor Module Pin Diagram
 
S  = Output     ---->  A0
Middle    = power supply  ---->  3V3
GND   = ground   ---->  GND

CODE
C:\Users\JUBY JOHN\Desktop\Projects\prjt 4 Smart HOme Automation\prgms

PROCEDURE
Step 1 : Interface ESP8266 microcontroller to Arduino IDE using port.
Step 2: Interface ESP8266 microcontroller with LDR and print analog resistance values on serial monitor.
Step 3 : Modify the program to get desired outputs on serial  monitor

PROBLEMS 
Error 1 -   After uploading , serial monitor shows nothing
How to rectify:
After uploading, we need to press RST button of ESP8266. It is because that after uploading the sketch,it works for as long as you donâ€™t open the serial monitor, but stops the moment you open it.

Error 2 -   Analog reading loop keeps working,its not getting out the loop.
How to rectify:
You need to add "return 0" instead your loop to get outside when it gets data other than mentioned  data
OUTPUT
On serial monitor , when RST button of ESP8266 pressed prints
