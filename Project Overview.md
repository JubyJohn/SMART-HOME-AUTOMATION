# PROJECT SMART HOME AUTOMATION


## AIM

To print smart home automation guide on serial monitor for lighting system


## COMPONENTS

1.	ESP8266 NodeMCU
2.	LDR Sensor Module
3.	USB cable
4.	Jumper Wire


## CONNECTION

### LDR Sensor Module Pin Diagram

<br> S  = Output     ---->  A0
<br> Middle    = power supply  ---->  3V3
<br> GND   = ground   ---->  GND


## PROCEDURE

<br> Step 1 : Interface ESP8266 microcontroller to Arduino IDE using port.
<br> Step 2: Interface ESP8266 microcontroller with LDR and print analog resistance values on serial monitor.
<br> Step 3 : Modify the program to get desired outputs on serial  monitor


## PROBLEMS 

### Error 1 -   After uploading , serial monitor shows nothing
#### How to rectify:
After uploading, we need to press RST button of ESP8266. It is because that after uploading the sketch,it works for as long as you donâ€™t open the serial monitor, but stops the moment you open it.

### Error 2 -   Analog reading loop keeps working,its not getting out the loop.
#### How to rectify:
You need to add "return 0" instead your loop to get outside when it gets data other than mentioned  data.


## OUTPUT

<br> On serial monitor , when RST button of ESP8266 pressed prints
<br> SMART HOME
<br> a) Auto Mode       b) Manual Mode      	 c) exit 
<br> Choose Your option....
<br> Type -> a
<br> Auto Mode Activated
<br> DAY TIME - LED OFF       // when light is detected by LDR, LED turned OFF
<br> NIGHT TIME - LED ON   // when no light is detected by LDR, LED turned ON
<br> Type -> c
<br> SMART HOME
<br> a) Auto Mode       b) Manual Mode      	 c) exit 
<br> Choose Your option......
<br> Type -> b
<br> Manual Mode Activated
<br> Type -> a for LED ON         Type -> b for LED OFF
<br> Type -> c
<br> SMART HOME
<br> a) Auto Mode       b) Manual Mode      	 c) exit 
<br> Choose Your option......
